SIO objective mapping code in fortran
llehmann@ucsd.edu

Notes:

"q" SIO files (full resolution, QC'd) use Sippican original coefficients
"e" SIO files (vertically averaged to 2m bins, QC'd) use Sippican original coefficients
".10" SIO files (10m averaged bins (from "e" files) use Hanawa 1995 coefficients

sio_mapxbt3.f reads ".10" file to output objectively mapped grids (0.1 degree spacing) 
     (also can create grids: salinity and specific volume anomaly using 
      a salinity version (.10s) of the .10 file)
