S, abstract                     = The Ship of Opportunity XBT Network has been measuring upper ocean temperature aboard volunteer vessels for several decades in key locations of the global ocean. The XBT SOOP lines are low cost, high resolution, and repeatable, which are key factors for the improvement of ocean state estimates and climate studies. The data from several transects across the global ocean is synthesized to provide high-quality gridded datasets of temperature and derived salinity and absolute geostrophic velocity across boundary currents. This product will provide a tool for model and reanalysis validation and will also support future studies related to key boundary currents.
