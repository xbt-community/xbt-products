## xbt-products repository
The repository is for XBT data producers to develop XBT data products and visualisation tools for the XBT SOOP (eXpendable BathyThermograph Ship Of Opportunity) Data Management Team.

The codes and data are referenced in the paper "GOXBT: A high-resolution boundary current product from Gridded Observations of eXpendable BathyThermograph (XBT) transects"

Each XBT line represented in the paper has a folder with code specific to that section. 

The utlities_code folder contains scripts used by all lines. The paper_figures folder contains code that created the figures in the paper from the gridded data for each line. 

The user is advised that these codes are not streamlined for ease of use.

The gridded dataset is available via the Zenodo XBT-DMT community: https://zenodo.org/communities/xbt-dmt/ (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17128134)
